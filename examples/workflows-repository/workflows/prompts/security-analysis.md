# Security Analysis Phase

Analyze the codebase for security vulnerabilities:

1. **Input Validation**: Check for injection vulnerabilities
2. **Authentication/Authorization**: Review access controls
3. **Data Handling**: Check for sensitive data exposure
4. **Dependencies**: Review third-party dependencies
5. **Configuration**: Check for security misconfigurations

**Restrictions**: This subroutine disallows Write, Edit, and Bash tools.
You can only read and analyze - no modifications.

Document all findings for the security report.
